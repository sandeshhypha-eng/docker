# DAST workflow for the Flask app using OWASP ZAP.
# This workflow starts the Flask app, runs a ZAP baseline scan inside a container,
# collects HTML/JSON/XML reports into `zap-reports/`, uploads them as artifacts,
# and prints a compact summary to the Actions log using `.github/zap_parse.py`.
name: Python CI/CD with  DAST, Docker

on:
  # Manual trigger and PR trigger. `workflow_dispatch` lets you run this from the
  # Actions UI and optionally provide inputs in the future.
  workflow_dispatch:
  # Run on pull requests so DAST runs on PR branches before merge.
